## Roman Numeral Calculator

This kata is meant to be a calculator that is able to return roman numerals. You can put the limit. I would start just calculating till 100 or below and then upgrade to the next limit.
Some basics of the roman numerals. They have some base *numbers* (just to call so) that can be joint following some formulas to get others. There is no 0 in such list!

Roman Numerals Main *Numbers*
* I = 1.
* V = 5.
* X = 10.
* L = 50.
* C = 100.
* D = 500.
* M = 1000.

## About Test Driven Development

TDD is not a testing tool but a **software design tool** that will help us to build solid applications. The basics of TDD can be summarised as follow and this flow is known as "red, green, refactor". There are 3 steps:

1. Write a failing (red) test
1. Make the test pass (green)
1. Refactor your code as needed to keep it clean while keeping the tests passing

To "test drive" this kata, just start for the simplest case and wait that you solution won't run, then fix it until it passes the test and refactor it as soon as you feel that code is duplicated or becomes a mess.
