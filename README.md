# tdd-kata-practises
Here you can find some katas or practises to start with TDD. Feel free to clone / fork them. I will provide the skeleton and the solution in a separate solution

Most of them will be solved using .Net Core but also some could be done using Node.js or Python or all of them :)

Solutions that are .Net Core based have been developed using Visual Studio 2019 for Mac but can be opened with Visual Studio Community Edition and Visual Studio Code as well.

For all those that are Node.js based I use Mocha library as the unit testing framework, with VSC (MacOS). Here you are the "recipe" to get it working -> https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-recipes/tree/master/debugging-mocha-tests
